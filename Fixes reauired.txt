ROC for 208 seems low

KSAN broken

export nice pdf for single run

write output option needs to be on left UI panel

the airport information needs to be cleaned up inthe UI output side

error at top about not enought fuel, instead at end of data section

	in single-run mode, the segment 5 for C208B should not be increasing mach number, segment 5 is a climb at a set mach, if over the knee.  this is suspicious as the config file should have the proper IAS and M for climb targets.

need airspeed grid option in batch for turboprops

do we need combined output files in batch

VTAS is high in batch mode only

	in batch mode, we need indicated airspeed in the summary utput csvs.

---looks like the altitude restriction for single run is not enforced.  CJ at 43000?

---when i run a single-run plane at the same altitude, the indicated and true values in the output summary csv are higher for batch.

---the sig digs int he summary csvs need to be 0 for distance, and vkias



	the Vpseeda on landing should be calculated at the beginning of segment 11 
	in the UI output, i want the second plot to be an altitude and speeds vs distance plot, IAS TAS, just like the Altitude and Mach vs. Distance


	6 to 7 fuel flow increase
	file output folders per run, not stramlit launch
	sfc issues
	ISA in output headers
	2 second output for files
	Enable v1 cuts is redundant in the UI oputput page
	fuel flows are still jumpy for turboprops
	Git
	landing secttion end weight is none
